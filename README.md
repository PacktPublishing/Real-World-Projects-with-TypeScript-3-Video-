# Real-World Projects with TypeScript 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real-World Projects with TypeScript 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/dreal-world-projects-with-typescript-3-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
When it comes to writing clean, object-oriented code in JavaScript, its complexity grows with the size of the project. Typescript helps alleviate this by allowing you to write clean, typed, object-oriented code in order to keep your projects neat, organized, and easy to understand and maintain.
This course is thoroughly engaging and practical, focusing on building four applications using TypeScript 3. We begin by demonstrating networking by creating a chat application (using WebSockets and Node.js) and a blog application (using TypeScript with a C# backend); we then enhance a blog website by wiring it up to a SQL database. The course builds on existing concepts while simultaneously introducing new ones. You will then make a bill pay tracking desktop application using Electron 5 and then an Android phonebook application using Cordova. You'll learn how to take advantage of various TypeScript features that comply with the most recent standards and design principles. 
Throughout the course, you will also learn how to enhance code quality using linting; how to perform unit tests and implement code coverage; and how to implement a continuous integration setup to ensure every code commit is as high-quality as possible. 
By the end of the course, you'll be confident about designing and building a series of practical and user-friendly TypeScript 3 apps.
